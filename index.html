	<h1>Clariah Structured Data Hub (CSDH)</h1>

	<p>The Clariah Structured Data Hub (CSDH) aims to recover and connect datasets on social and economic history that now live in isolation. <i>Recover</i> in the sense that there are many projects for which datasets were created, but never appropriately cleaned and published. <i>Connect</i> in the sense that many of these datasets use similar variables such as occupation, sex or Gross Domestic Product, but there are virtual no procedures available to link these datasets (other than manual linkage through scripting). CSDH creates both tools to make the recovery and linkage easier, but also provides a series of strategic databases as linked open data.</p>

<p> The advantages of CDSH are:	
	<ul class="sq">
		<li>Preservation of strategic historical datasets</li>
		<li>Disclosure of datasets as Linked Open Data</li>
		<li>Tooling to transpose your data into Linked Open Data</li>
	</ul>
